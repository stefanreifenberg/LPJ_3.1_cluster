## Simulating forest stocks, growth, and management in south-western Germany with a regionalized Dynamic Global Vegetation Model at high spatial resolution.
Full LPJ_GUESS Source Code used for all runs on the the BWUniCluster. 

**Climate data** can be downloaded [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qxwm7w5zvjfok1q/AADc_5a9Xnu17_1V3FGmlFuha?dl=0)

Instruction file for each species can be found in the folder **instruction_files**.
To run the model paths need to be modified to meet your system requirements.
- europe_cf.txt (general instructions)
- europe_v3.1_Final_pic_abi.txt (instructions for picea abies species)
- europe_v3.1_Final_abi_alb.txt (instructions for picea abies alba)
- europe_v3.1_Final_que_rob.txt (instructions for quercus robur species)
- europe_v3.1_Final_fag_syl.txt (instructions for fagus sylvatica species)

**Gridlists** for the different tree species are in the gridlists folder. Information include gridcell coordinates and a soiltype for each cell.
